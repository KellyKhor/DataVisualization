# Vaccination Data Visualization
An interactive data visualization project analyzing vaccination trends in Europe from 2013â€“2023.
This was a group project as part of my Data Visualizations courssse. I specifically worked on the Healthcare Expenditure Bubble Chart and the Vaccination Costs Line Chart, both built using D3.js.

## Features
### Healthcare Expenditure (Bubble Chart)
- Displays healthcare spending across European countries.
- Bubble size encodes expenditure; hover tooltips reveal vaccination coverage and GDP.
- Interactive filtering by year and disease for focused exploration.
- Force-collision layout to prevent overlaps, improve readability and add dynamic interactivity for viewers.

### Vaccination Costs Over Time (Line Chart)
- Tracks changes in vaccine prices over time.
- Interactive hover tooltips show exact costs and year-over-year percentage changes.
- Gridlines for easier comparison and animated line transitions.
- Animated line graph upon page loading.
  
## Tech Stack
- Language: JavaScript
- Library: D3.js
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS

## What I Learned
- Creating interactive data visualizations with D3.js.
- Designing bubble charts with force simulations for collision handling.
- Building dynamic line charts with animations and hover tooltips.
- Improving usability with filtering, legends, and interactive tooltips.
- Applying visual design principles to make data trends clear and engaging.
